<p style="text-align: center">Welcome to My Blog!</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">I'm a second-year Computer Science student with a unique background — I hold a Master's degree in Biomedical Sciences, specializing in Neuroscience. However, my true passion has always been in the world of IT. Over time, I've developed a deep fascination with system administration, Linux, and cybersecurity. As a passionate beginner in the field, I’m eager to share my journey, explore new technologies, and dive deeper into the ever-evolving world of IT. Join me as I continue learning, experimenting, and growing in this exciting field!</p>
